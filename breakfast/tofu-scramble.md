## Tofu scramble

A hearty and adaptable breakfast dish. This is also good for using up small quantities of veggies

## Ingredients
  - silken tofu. (firm does not give the same consistency.)
  - onions
  - garlic
  - cooking oil or vegan butter
      - spinach
      ## Spices
        - turmeric
        - salt
        - pepper
        - optional: whatever suitable dried herbs you have to hand (basil, oregano, thyme etc.)
        - optional: spices - paprika, chilli, cumin, white pepper etc.
        - optional: add any suitable veggies that you have to hand (peppers, broccoli, courgette etc. potatoes will require more time in the pan!)
  
## Instructions
  - heat your oil or butter in a pan
  - saute diced onions and garlic until soft and translucent
  - crumble up your silken tofu and add to pan
  - add any extra veggies, sliced finely or or diced small as you prefer
  - add spices. (turmeric is particularly important as it adds yellowness and a sulfurous tang!)
  - cook on high heat in the pan while stirring continuously to prevent burn. add a bit more vegan butter to make creamy if you prefer
  - add spinach
  - serve the scramble topped with any fresh herbs!
